# LendingClubCaseStudy
Repository containing submissions files for Lending Club Case Study

## Objective
This case study is focussed on a consumer finance company which is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures.
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed

#### Goal
Understand the driving factors behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default
This analysis can help the company reduce risky loans, thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss
